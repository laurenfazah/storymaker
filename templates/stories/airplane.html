	<h1>My First Airplane Ride</h1>
	<br>
	<p>My parents surprised my sisters and me saying that we were going on vacation next week. We are going on an airplane for the first time ever - we were so excited!</p>
	<br>
	I’ve always wanted to go on an airplane. We asked when and where we are going. Mom looked at us and giggled but didn’t answer. We jumped on our parents and begged, 'Please! Please tell us where we are going on vacation!' They pointed to their lips and kept them both smacked together...they said their lips are sealed.</p>
	<br>
	<p>When we woke up the next morning we tried to trick our parents into telling us where we will go on vacation, but they wouldn’t say a word. We tried and tried and tried, but nothing! We called our grandparents and asked them and they also wouldn’t tell us where we we're going. They promised our parents not to say. The next morning we asked again and they still wouldn’t answer us. So, we decided just to wait and see where the airplane will take us.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Finally, today was the day of our trip. We went downstairs for breakfast and saw our suitcases, we each had our own. Mom packed all of them last night. Mine was {{ user[2] }} and had a nametag on it that said {{ user[0] }}.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Dad said the taxi will be here to take up to the airport in one hour! We jumped up and down we couldn’t wait a second longer. Then Dad was holding something behind his back. Then he told us to close our eyes. He put something on our heads and gave us each a mirror. We opened our eyes and we each had on Mickey Mouse ears with our names sewn onto them. The only word that came out of our mouths was, "YIPPEE!" We were going on an airplane for the first time ever to Disney. We thanked and kissed our parents. "Thank you! Thank you!"</p>
	<br>
	<p>As we were screaming with joy we couldn’t hear the taxi blowing his horn. We did hear the doorbell, though. We wondered who was at the door this early in the morning. Mom opened the door and saw a funny looking man with a cap on, and he didn’t look too happy! He asked my mom if this was the {{ user.last_name }}’s residence. Mom answered, "Yes." He was driving our family to the airport.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The taxi driver took our suitcases and put them in the trunk. Mom sat in the front seat and dad and the three of us sat in the backseat. "Off we go!" the driver said, then he started to sing "M I C K E Y, M O U S E... Mickey Mouse". After that he sang It’s a Small World. Who would have thought this driver would be so much fun!</p>
	<br>
	<p>He drove into the airport parking lot and brought our suitcases to the curb, hugged us and told our family to have a great time. We checked our suitcases and went through security and then we waited to hear our flight number. Finally they announced our flight and we started to line up to board the plane.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The stewardess showed us where our seats were. Before the engine started, the pilot came out of the cockpit to greet all the children and gave each of the us an airplane wings pin to wear.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Then we fastened our seatbelts and heard the engines roar and the propellers spin. The plane started to move, then went faster and faster until it picked up enough speed and left the ground. Our tummies tickled. We were flying. We were actually flying!</p>
	<br>
	<p>A lot of time passed and finally it was time to land the plane. It was getting closer and closer to the ground then "SWISSSSH" - we landed! We got off the plane and told dad we couldn't wait to go back on the plane for our ride home.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Disney was so much fun! But the best ride of the vacation was definitely our airplane ride.  After our plane ride back from Disney, dad called a taxi to take our family home from the airport. We picked up our suitcases from the carousel and walked out of the airport and waited for the taxi. We didn’t wait too long until we heard a horn blow. We looked and laughed - it was the same taxi driver as before! We all sang It's a Small World the whole way home.</p>
