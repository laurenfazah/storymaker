<h1>A Day at the Beach</h1>
<br>
<p>My mommy and daddy took us to the beach. We had so much fun.
We swam. <br>
We played in the sand. <br>
We even buried dad in the sand. <br>
We had so much fun until it was time for lunch. Mom packed our favorite foods...peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and ham and cheese sandwiches and of course {{ beach.fav_food }}.</p>
<br>
<p>We started to eat our lunch and... <br>
'Whissh' <br>
The seagulls flew down, landed right next to us and took our sandwiches!	We looked at mom and dad and we all began to laugh! </p>
<br>
<p>Dad took us to the snack bar and we had lunch there.	On the way home from the beach, we stopped for ice cream. I picked out {{ beach.ice_cream_flavor }}. As we were eating the ice cream we looked at each other and we burst out laughing! We couldnâ€™t stop!</p>
<br>
<p>It was such a great day at the beach. <br>
Dad said we can go back again next week! <br>
Mom said absolutely no sandwiches!</p>
