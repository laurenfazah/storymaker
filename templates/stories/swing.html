		<h1>My New Swing</h1>
		<br>
		<p>My new swing goes very, very high. <br>
		It is {{ fav_color }} and doesn't squeak like the one at the playground does.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I can almost reach the sky with my swing. <br>
		I can swing so high that I know I'll touch the clouds one day.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I go outside and play on the swing everyday. I have so much fun.
		When my friends come over, we try to see who can go the highest.
		My friend {{ friend_name }} said that my swing is better than the one at the playground.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I know someday I will go the highest and I will be the first one to touch the sky. I'll grab a handful of the clouds and bring it back down to show everyone I really touched the sky.</p>
