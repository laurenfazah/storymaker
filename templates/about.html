	<p>StoryMaker is a personalized story generator for children. Once information about the child pertaining to each story is entered, stories are presented for you. Not only can your child use your computer's mouse to draw on each story's page, but you also have the option to print or save each creation. We hope you enjoy StoryMaker!</p>
