	<h3 id="about-blurb">StoryMaker is a personalized story generator for children. Once information for each story is entered, custom stories are presented for you. Not only can your child use your computer's mouse to draw a picture on each story's page, but you also have the option to print or save each creation. We hope you enjoy StoryMaker!</h3>
